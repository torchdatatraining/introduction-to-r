# Comments ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is a comment - comments will not be run as code. It is good practice to
# comment your code thoroughly. This will help you when you come back to look at
# the script in the future or helps someone else understand what is going on 
# when they look at your code. Comment lines always start with a hashtag.

# Functions --------------------------------------------------------------------

print("Hello world") # this is how you use the built-in print function

# Packages ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# You only need to install the package once. You need to load it with library
# everytime you start a new session if you want to use it.

# To install a package

install.packages("dplyr")

library("dplyr")

# require(dplyr) you will see tutorial online loading packages using require. 
# Don't do this (for now anyway).

library(dplyr) # you dont need the quote marks here for this particular function

# Exercise for you -------------------------------------------------------------

# Install the libraries ggplot2 and readr. No need to load them yet.
